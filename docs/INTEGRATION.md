# Backend Integration Guide (BoostBit)

This document describes how to integrate `oss-metrics-kit` into the existing BoostBit backend (Postgres + web API).

## Install in backend

- As a dependency (recommended):
  - pip: `pip install oss-metrics-kit[exporters-postgres]`
  - uv: `uv add oss-metrics-kit[exporters-postgres]`
- Local dev (monorepo): add as editable: `pip install -e .[exporters-postgres]`

## Environment variables

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN`: GitHub API token (required)
- `OSSMK_PG_DSN` or `DATABASE_URL`: Postgres DSN for persistence, e.g. `postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db`
- Optional rules override: `BOOSTBIT_RULES_FILE` pointing to TOML.

## Programmatic API (recommended)

```python
from ossmk.core.services.analyze import analyze_github_user
from ossmk.storage.postgres import connect, ensure_schema, save_scores

# after OAuth completes and you have GitHub login
login = "<github_login>"
result = analyze_github_user(login, rules="default")
# result.summary -> FE friendly dict
# result.scores -> list of score dicts for persistence

# optional Postgres persistence
with connect() as conn:
    ensure_schema(conn)
    save_scores(conn, result.scores)
```

- The object `result` is safe to JSON serialize and return to the frontend. It provides a concise summary and full scores.

## CLI (ops/scripting)

- Analyze and return summary: `ossmk analyze-user <login> --out -`
- Persist scores to Postgres: `ossmk analyze-user <login> --save-pg`

## Security best practices

- Never log GitHub tokens. Store tokens in the backend secret manager or environment.
- Use least-privileged GitHub token scopes for read-only access.
- The Postgres DSN should be provided through secret envs and never committed.
- `.gitignore` in this repo ignores typical secret files and proprietary assets.

## Data model (persistence)

- Table `ossmk_scores` stores per-user, per-dimension, per-window scores. The CLI/API writes here by default.
- Table `ossmk_events` is available if you want to persist normalized events; call `save_events(conn, events)` (expose events in your integration code if needed).

## Extending rules (closed-source)

- Place a TOML rules file in a private path (e.g., `private/boostbit_rules.toml`).
- Set `BOOSTBIT_RULES_FILE=/path/to/boostbit_rules.toml` in the backend environment.
- The analyzer will load those rules automatically when `rules="default"` is passed.

```toml
[dimensions.code]
kinds = ["pr", "commit"]
weight = 1.2

[dimensions.community]
kinds = ["issue"]
weight = 0.7
```

## Notes

- Current GitHub provider fetches issues/PRs per repo and the list of user repos (first page). For large accounts, implement pagination and parallelism as needed.
- HTTP requests use ETag caching when possible and exponential backoff retries.
